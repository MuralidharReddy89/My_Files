                                                     ethical hacker  concept
we have know the network 
when two device build a communication then there is network
wire network-- ethernet(eth0) and wireless network -- wifi
share data through network
remote connection and communication
sharing resources such as printers , fax and datsbases
sensors - monitors
client - servers
data stored in database. if i request is send database i want particular data that database will response will display
multifacility working together
costafective less - means less price 
reliability
networking components:
1.APP(mobile,computer,laptop) - PROTOCAl - it is a set of rules
                                                    - network as some rules
common language of app is protocal
2. NIC HOST PROTOCAL

example 
instagram- message , videocall, reels , comments, likes,followers

Transmission media

CLIENT / SERVER -  2 step of understanding
web browser - chrome - A browser is a piece of software that retrieves and display web pages 
a search engine is a website that hepls people find web pages from other websites.
peer - peer 
 no dedicated server

SOURCE - DESTINATION
(HOST1)    (HOST2) {transmission}/ sending

EXAMPLE
 banaganpalli - yaganti

TRANSMISSION TYPES
1 --  Unicast => direct device to device 
2 -- Multicast => one to some or group - host avaliable
3 -- Broadcast => one to all 

BOUNDED AND UNBOUNDED NETWORKS
BOUNDED
 1 - Wired
        uses metalic and optical
        limits bundaries
UNBOUNDED
 1 - Wired 
         radio waves cable
         unlimited


                                                       1.  Network scope

1) LAN   - local area network(limited)
               - geographically limited network - buildings, floor,rooms,campus
               - equipment-(own)
                 wired - wireless , segments = using optical fibers
                ( cpmputer resources) 
                 OSI MODEL - open system interconnection(OSI LAYER)
2)WLAN - (wireless local area network)
                 - lan based technology , wireless
                 (wifi)
                 adds security level more and more
                 risky risky.
                extension of lan . larger lan
3)WAN - wide area network.
              - multiple lans . isp(internet service provider) or telcommunications
              - the internet is the ultimate wan
              - ppp
4)OTHERS...
                 PAN- personal area network
                          hostpot, bluetooth , iot devices ,surroundings
                MAN- metropolitian area network .
                         limited(fibers)
                CAN-compus area network
                    local environments . limited geographical 


                                                           2.Network Addressing


-host anmes
-netbios
-ip address
-MAC
       network address :
                - one device to another device .communication build
                - different services on same device or another service
        DNS- domain name system (or) service  gan-(global area network)
hostname : friendly name
