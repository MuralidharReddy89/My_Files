Soldiers wear sensors that monitor their health and location. These sensors track things like heart rate and activity levels. They're connected to a GPS that shows where each soldier is. All this data is sent wirelessly using the GSM network to a mobile app on each soldier's device. This app lets soldiers see their health info in real-time. All the soldier data goes to a central command center, which is connected to a server. The server stores and analyzes the data. Visualization tools help commanders understand the info better. If something goes wrong, like a soldier gets hurt, the system sends alerts to commanders so they can help.
